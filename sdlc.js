// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// 1. Planning
// 2. Analysis of Requirements
// 3. Design
// 4. Implementation
// 5. Testing & Integration
// 6. Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, where developers get and understand the needs and wants of the client and stakeholders"
const design = "This is the third step, where plans and ideas are put tangible things wheather that is a prototype or a flowchart of how the software works"
const implementation = "This is the fourth step, where the flowcharts and product specifications are coded."
const testingAndIntegration = "This is the fifth step, where your software that you created is tried and tested with users and outside environments, to which it is is released."
const maintain = "This the sixth step, this step is usually never finished as you will continue to maintain your software through upgrades and changes in the demands."
